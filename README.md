The Drum Kit project is a web-based application that allows users to play different drum sounds using their keyboard and on mouse click. 
The application consists of various drum sounds mapped to different keys on the keyboard and by adding even listener to the mouse.
When a user presses a key on their keyboard, the corresponding drum sound plays, and an animation is displayed to indicate which key was pressed.
